# CityScapes
Overall Mark: 24/25

Description:
Follow a set of randomised instructions to produce a city which specifies where each building is placed, the specific style of building, number of floors and whether the building was still in construction or not. 

This program explores how to:
  - process lists of data values
  - display information in a visual form
  - produce maintainable, reusable code
